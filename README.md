# Disclaimer

- this auto-bot is not stabil and going to development
- You can test it but rpc and blockchain is not stabil
- Today Gasfee is high so you need many aogi

# Featured

- Create Random text on temp/temp.txt and upload to 0glabs storage turbo
- Using 0glabs Official Sdk To upload file
- Swap ( Soon )

Because the blockchain is dregs, this machine can only upload files once a day, but fortunately every day this machine will automatically upload 1 file to push tx.
The Swap feature is still difficult and unstable so I just turned it off, but the machine framework is already on github.

This machine is suitable for those who work on it but have difficulty uploading files to push tx

This machine is still unstable
